feat: add interactive init command with Clef mascot

- Introduced Clef, an animated cat mascot for enhanced user experience
- Implemented clean, minimal CLI prompts following modern design patterns
- Added four configuration presets: Conventional Commits, Gitmoji, Angular, and Minimal
- Created interactive setup flow with preset selection, emoji support, and scope configuration
- Integrated animated character that appears at key moments: intro, processing, and outro
- Automatic YAML configuration file generation with validation
- Non-intrusive design with clean labels and compact spacing
- Graceful degradation for terminals without animation support
